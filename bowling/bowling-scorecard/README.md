# Project title

The 'Bowling Scorecard' is a simple command line application.

## Motivation / Approach

This project was made to develop best practice Ruby skills.

I firstly created this readme, created the frame for the project and wrote as
many user stories as i could think of at the time.

Those user stories were created on branches and merged in to keep practicing and
develop my git skills alongside the coding.

When a strike is bowled, the bowler is awarded the score of 10 (for knocking
down all ten pins), plus he gets to add the total of his next two rolls to that
frame.  For a spare, the bowler gets the 10, plus the total number of pins
knocked down on the next roll only.

### Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is
a practice exercise.

### Screenshots / UML / Notes / Diagrams

Should there be any images, please find them in the images folder of the project.

### User Stories

As a bowler,
I want to get a score of zero when i throw only gutter balls,
so that my correct score is recorded.
DONE

As a bowler,
I want to get a score of 20 when i hit only one pin each time,
so that my correct score is recorded.

As a bowler,
I want to get a score of 300 when i get a strike each time,
so that my correct score is recorded.

As a bowler,
I want to be stopped from rolling more balls than I am allowed to,
so that I can stay within the rules of the game.

As a bowler,
I want to roll all the balls that i am allowed,
so that I can maxamise my score.

As a bowler,
I want to get the right score from a spare,
so that I can maxamise my score.

## Tech / framework used

An apple macbook was used to write code using VSCode as an editor and;

* Ruby was used as the main language.
* RSpec used for testing.
* Simplecov is used for test coverage.

### Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code.

### Tests

A TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the
attached spec files for details of the testing that was carried out.

## Installation / Running / How it works

Please find attached a gem file listing those gems for installation, this is a
command line application.

## API Use

No API used in this project.

## Reflection / further development

WHAT FURTHER FEATURES WOULD I ADD IF I HAD MORE TIME?

## Credits / team members

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise.

I  used this website to help with quick math calculations on scoring.

I created this code by myself with no exteral assistance, or tutorials, although
I had to look up how to score a strike and a spare!
