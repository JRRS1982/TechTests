# Project title

Fizzbuzz is a simple programme, used for coding practice. In this instance it was written in Javascript.

## Motivation

This project was made to develop my coding skills in Jvascript and Jasmine, both of which are languages which I had not
worked with before the start of this week. I am completing this project following a strict TDD process, and trying to
follow best practice to hone my development skills.

### Build status
  
As far as I am concerned this project is complete. Currently I created functions for various arguments, although I
recognise that this could be reduced in size I am happy as the features work and it can be easily updated.

### Screenshots

No screen shots were taken.
