# FizzBuzz: in Python

This is my first attempt at a Python program, having never
used the language before and being keen to learn it, I have
installed it to a virtual env locally and installed the
dependencies required to create my first Python programme.

Firstly experimenting with a hello world script, then a
tutorial I moved onto the classic logic of fizzbuzz.

## Input / output types

Input: hard coded integer.
Output: range of numbers on new lines, replaced by 3 when
multiples of 3, and buzz, when multiples of five, or
fizzbuzz when multiple of 3 and 5.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given input: 1
Output should be: 1

Given input: 3
Output should be: fizz

Given input: 5
Output should be: buzz

Given input: 4
Output should be: 4

Given input: 15
Output should be: fizzbuzz

##Â Instructions

clone the repo, run python3 fizzbuzz.py from the command line.
